                agreements, and international institutional law. No liability
                arises from policy-induced temporal shifts, systemic
                recalibrations, institutional directives, collective governance
                outcomes, or good-faith implementation of authorized mandates.

                This Framework is reviewed at minimum every five years, or more
                frequently when required by technological developments,
                regulatory reforms, societal feedback mechanisms, independent
                evaluations, internal audits, and scientific advances.

                Participation in SYNCHRO systems constitutes formal recognition
                of time as a collective governance resource and of temporal data
                as a strategic public asset. Through standardized measurement,
                coordinated analysis, institutional supervision, multilateral
                cooperation, and continuous evaluation, the PGTC seeks to
                promote equitable, efficient, transparent, and sustainable
                temporal governance at planetary scale. SYNCHRO affirms its
                obligation to implement this mandate with technical rigor,
                administrative transparency, procedural fairness, institutional
                loyalty, and full multilateral accountability.
